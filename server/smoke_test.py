"""Dedicated server smoke test, in three runs of a headless server on one world:
1. no player IDs: another build and a wrong shared password are refused; a
   client joins, walks into a new area the server has to make, and is saved;
2. player IDs, open: no ID is refused, a first login makes an ID, a wrong
   password is refused, the same ID on a second device gets the same character
   back, and a device that played before IDs keeps its character;
3. player IDs, closed: an unknown ID is refused until `account add` makes it.
