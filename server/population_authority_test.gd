# A dedicated server as the authority of every area's Pokemon
# (coop_population_authority.gd, area_sim.gd), without a network: two areas
# the server holds without drawing them, each with wild Pokemon, a pair left
# in a habitat and an egg in its records and a player in it. The server runs
# both (within its frame budget); what it sends (binary motion frames and
# commits) laid on each player's copy of its area leaves every Pokemon where
# the server has it, and the server's frames are only those it may send.
# Players' commands with the server the authority: a claim holds a Pokemon
# still and out of what is sent, a battle run from puts it back where the
# server has it, a catch or a friendly one recruited takes it away, a habitat
# Pokemon called back after it walked on (its step not yet sent) is gone and
# not sent back, one left in a habitat is run there, an egg taken angers its
# parents, an item dropped on the ground blocks its cell as in a World. A new
# area made by the server gets its first Pokemon, Megas and Mega Gengar from
# its seed (server_area_maker.gd first_population, the same each time), and
# its player's copy read from the records is the server's. Authority: the
# server is every area's (coop_state.gd fixed_authority) whoever comes and
# goes; with players as authorities (a phone hosting) an area passes to the
# next player with a new epoch and the one before may no longer send it.
# Run: godot --headless --path project -s ../server/population_authority_test.gd
